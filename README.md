  ## Description 
  A node application meant to easily produce a Professional README file. 

  ## Installation
  Clone the repo onto your local machine, and make sure inquirer is installed. 

  ## Usage
  To properly use the application first follow the installation instructions.  Then in the terminal enter 'node index.js'.  Follow the prompts and you will have a Professional README. 

  ## Contribution 
  Anyone can feel free to contribute.  All that I ask is that you fork the repo and give the original creators credit where it is due.
